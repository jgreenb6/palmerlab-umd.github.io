title: Coastal Plain wetlands and stream networks

Historically, the mid-Atlantic had vast expanses of low-lying forests with extensive freshwater wetlands and streams. Much of this land has been converted to farming over the last several hundred years. Ongoing pressures include continued farming and the growth of suburban developments. In recognition of the need for new approaches to systematically monitor and assess hydrologic conditions, wetland/stream ecosystem functions, and their impact on water quality, Palmer and colleagues have work on-going in the Eastern Shore of Maryland. This includes using remotely sensed data, particularly radar and lidar, and extensive field sampling and experimentation, to quantify a variety of ecological functions in depressional wetlands that connect to stream networks under certain hydrologic conditions.
