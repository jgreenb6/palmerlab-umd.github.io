Worldwide, there are many efforts to restore wetlands lost due to agriculture or other forms of land use change. In the U.S. some of these fall into a category called “Geographically Isolated Wetlands (GIWs).” Our work has been focusing on GIWs on the Delmarva peninsula of the east coast U.S. where we are quantifying the patterns of connectivity of restored, natural, and agricultural wetlands to perennial stream networks. Among other differences, these three classes of wetlands vary in the duration and patterns of their connectivity as well as the amount and composition of dissolved organic matter flowing from them.
