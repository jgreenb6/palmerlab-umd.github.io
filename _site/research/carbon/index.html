<meta name="description" content="Wetlands are among the most threatened ecosystems on earth yet they play extremely valuable roles in global elemental cycling. As transition points in the landscape between the terrestrial and aquatic realms, they are well known as sources of C production and biomass accumulation, as well as sinks of C received from the surrounding terrestrial environments. Despite their potential importance to understanding carbon fluxes they have not been adequately integrated into global scale terrestrial carbon budgets or into inland water carbon budgets. The Palmer lab has teamed with colleagues Michael Gonsior (organic chemist – aquatic systems and DOC; UMCES), Laura Lapham (biogeochemist - methane cycling; UMCES), Greg McCarty (Hydrology &amp; remote sensing; USDA), Kate Tully (soil biogeochemist, UM) and members of Daniel McLaughlin’s lab (hydrology, VT) to understand how wetland inundation and hydrologic connectivity influences carbon fluxes and stores. The Coastal Plain field sites are on the Eastern Shore of Maryland where members of Palmer’s lab have worked for a number of years. Restored and natural wetlands in this predominantly agricultural region appear to be isolated during much of the year but work by past graduate students Owen McDonough, Jake Hosen, and Steve Epting have documented periods of extensive connectivity between wetlands and perennial streams via intermittent channels. Current work is expanding this to quantify the dynamic nature of wetland area above and below ground and how this influences the fluxes and lability of dissolved and gaseous organic carbon." />
