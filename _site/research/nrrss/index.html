<meta name="description" content="Through an NSF-NCEAS award and funding from the Packard and C.S. Mott Foundations, Dr. Palmer along with collaborators, Dr. J. D. Allan (University of Michigan) and former postdoc Dr. Emily Bernhardt (now at Duke University) organized the National River Restoration Science Synthesis (NRRSS) project. The goal of the NRRSS project was to provide a national level scientific synthesis that can be used to inform policy at local, regional, and national levels. The methods involved in-depth research at eight geographic regions in the United States. The U.S.G.S. was a partner in developing the database structure and they have helped us make the database publicly available (https://github.com/khondula/nrrss). Results from the national synthesis were published in Science in 2005 and results for the Chesapeake Bay region in Frontiers in Ecology &amp; the Environment in 2005. The second phase of this work involved interviewing a large number of practitioners to gather more detailed information on how projects were implemented, monitored, and their degree of success. The results from this work will appear in a special issue of the journal Restoration Ecology sometime in 2007. The NRRSS team has published an article proposing five criteria for evaluating the ecological success of a river restoration project. Their paper on proposed criteria is the lead article in a special issue of the British Ecological Society’s Journal of Applied Ecology have received positive comments from an international group of rivers scientists (Jansson et al. 2005) and from a group of restoration practitioners (Gillilan et al. 2005). All of these articles are in the February issue (volume 42 (1)) of the journal. Finally, Palmer and co-author Dave Allan have just published a paper with recommendations for federal policy changes to enhance the effectiveness of river restoration (Issues in Science and Technology 2006)." />
